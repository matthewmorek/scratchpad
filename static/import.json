[{"id":0,"content":"Welcome to Scratchpad!\n\nThis is a simple web application written in VueJS and built with Webpack. It uses `LocalStorage` to store data, and automatically saves your notes when you finish typing.\n\nThe note you're reading is supposed to give you a glimpse at what Scratchpad can do.\n\n- Add, modify and delete individual notes;\n- The first line will always be your note's title;\n- Use hashtags to tag your notes, throughout the content (it's best to keep them in the last line);\n- Export all notes to a JSON file.\n\nThere are probably bugs and other bits that aren't necessarily tested, but given the timeframe, it was an interesting exercise, so thanks!\n\n-Matthew\n\n#tutorial #deleteme"}]
